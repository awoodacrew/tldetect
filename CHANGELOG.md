#### Change Log

- 10/24/17

  - tested training using udacity-carnd-deep-learning ami on AWS p2.xlarge
  - added PYTHONPATH setup in README.md
  - encountered very slow training step performance using default AMI image
    - about 10 seconds per step
    - updated to tensorflow-gpu 1.3.0 and lowered training step timeot 1.5 sec
  - found a bug in supporting multiple classes and classes_text in generate_tfrecord.py
    - pushed the fix
    - updated the record files under training_data
  - ran a few trainining tests
    - changed ssd config to lower the maximum number of object detections from 100 to 50

  - alec

    - performed limited training on a macbook pro using ssd_inception_v2_coco_1106_2017 as a end-to-end test of the object detection pipeline from training to prediction

      - decreased batch_size from 24 to 12 in order to fit into the macbook pro's gpu

      - trained up to 410 steps and stopped.  Loss fluctuates around 2.0

      - will need to perform training on AWS with p2.xlarge, but got rejected by AWS as my AWS account is relatively new.
