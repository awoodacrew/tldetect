#### Overview

This repo contains the minimum steps to run tensorflow object detection training and inferencing for traffic light detection in the final udacity system integration project. The repo incorporates annotated training data from udacity rosbag files and udacity project simulator shared by :

#### Directory Structure

- tldetect/
  - deployment/, nets/, object_detection/
    - these direcotyr were copied from tensorflow/model commit:538f89c4121803645fe72f41ebfd7069c706d954
    - fixed was applied to object_detection/exporter.py (see commit log)
  - raw_annotated_data/ (from Anthony Sarkis)
  - generate_tfrecords.py
    - transform raw_annotated_data to TFExamples/TFRecords format for tensorflow training
  - models/
    - we can test different model by adding more directories here.  The first one is ssd_inception_v2_coco_11_06_2017_udacity_real
  - training_data/
    - contains outputs from generate_tfrecords.py
  - ssd_inception_v2_udacity_real_train.sh
    - a script to train a ssd_inception_v2 model using udacity real driving images
  - export_graph.sh
    - a script to export a trained model for inference
    - the inference model will be in a directory with the name defined in the script
  - test_images_real/
    - contains a few real driving images to test the inference model
  - test_images_simulator/
    - contains a few driving images from the simulator to test the inference model
  - predictor.py
    - based on tensorflow's object_detection sample, this code takes an object detection inference model and output the prediction



#### Add new models to train and test

To train using different models

1. All models should use the same training data under training_data/ and test data under either test_images_real/ or test_images_simulator/ (to be added)

2. Under models/, create your own model directory for training and try to name it by adding the model_name and what kind of data: e.g. ssd_inception_v2_coco_11_06_2017_udacity_real

3. Create your own training script similar to ssd_inception_v2_udacity_real_train.sh.

4. Modify the object_detection pipeline configuration.  For ssd_inception_v2_udacity_real, the configuration file is under: 

   `models/ssd_inception_v2_coco_11_06_2017_udacity_real/ssd_inception_v2_coco.config`

5. Change or create your own export_graph.sh to generate the inference model directory. 

6. Change or improve predictor.py to test your model.



#### Progress Update

- 10/22/17

  - alec

    - limited training on a macbook pro using ssd_inception_v2_coco_1106_2017 as a end-to-end test from training to prediction

      - decreased batch_size from 24 to 12 in order to fit into the macbook pro's gpu

      - trained up to 410 steps and stopped.  Loss fluctuates around 2.0
